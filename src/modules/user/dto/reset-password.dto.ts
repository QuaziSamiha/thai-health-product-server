//* THE OTP IS THE ONLY CREDENTIAL IN THIS PAYLOAD — THERE IS NO SEPARATE
//* "RESET TOKEN". THAT IS DELIBERATE AND MATCHES THE SCHEMA: UserSecurity's
//* resetToken/resetTokenExpires COLUMNS WERE DROPPED (MIGRATION
//* 20260813085902_drop_unused_user_security_tokens) SO THAT EVERY VERIFICATION
//* FLOW RUNS THROUGH THE `OTP` MODEL AND NOTHING ELSE. THE PRACTICAL EFFECT IS
//* THAT PROOF-OF-OWNERSHIP AND THE PASSWORD WRITE HAPPEN IN THE SAME REQUEST,
//* SO NO LONGER-LIVED CAPABILITY EVER SITS IN THE BROWSER BETWEEN THE TWO.
