//* PRISMA CLIENT EXTENSION — AUTOMATICALLY WRITES AN AuditLog ROW FOR EVERY

//*
//* WHY THIS CAPTURES `extendedClient` VIA A CLOSURE INSTEAD OF USING `this`:
//* THE OBVIOUS DESIGN — READING `this` INSIDE `$allOperations` TO CALL
//* SIBLING MODELS (`this.auditLog.create(...)`) — DOES NOT WORK ON THIS
//* PRISMA VERSION (7.7.0's rewritten, non-engine client architecture):
//* EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED (scratch script against a real DB) THAT `this` INSIDE
//* THE HOOK IS *NOT* THE EXTENDED CLIENT AND EXPOSES NO MODEL DELEGATES —
//* CONTRARY TO OLDER PRISMA DOCS/EXAMPLES. `Prisma.getExtensionContext(this)`
//* WAS ALSO TRIED AND DOESN'T HELP HERE EITHER (IT'S FOR `client`/`model`
//* EXTENSION COMPONENTS, NOT `query`). THE WORKING FIX: `Prisma.defineExtension`
//* TAKES A FACTORY CALLBACK WHOSE RETURN VALUE (THE EXTENDED CLIENT) IS
//* CAPTURED INTO `extendedClient` IMMEDIATELY, SYNCHRONOUSLY, BEFORE ANY QUERY
//* CAN RUN — SO EVERY HOOK INVOCATION CAN SAFELY USE IT.
//*
//* TRADE-OFF THIS FORCES: THE AUDIT WRITE NO LONGER PARTICIPATES IN THE SAME
//* DB TRANSACTION AS THE MUTATION IT RECORDS (IT RUNS ON A SEPARATE POOLED
//* CONNECTION), SO IT IS **NOT** ATOMIC WITH BaseRepository.withTransaction()
//* CALLS — IF A SURROUNDING TRANSACTION LATER ROLLS BACK FOR AN UNRELATED
//* REASON, AN AUDIT ROW FOR THE (NOW-UNDONE) MUTATION CAN STILL PERSIST. THIS
//* IS A DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED DEVIATION FROM THE ORIGINAL DESIGN GOAL (SEE
//* docs/audit-log.md, Known Gaps) — TRUE TRANSACTIONAL AUDIT WRITES WOULD
//* NEED EITHER A DIFFERENT PRISMA VERSION/API OR EXPLICIT `tx` THREADING,
//* WHICH IS EXACTLY THE PER-CALL-SITE BOILERPLATE THIS EXTENSION EXISTS TO AVOID.
