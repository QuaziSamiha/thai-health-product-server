Looking at your current structure, you have a solid NestJS base. Let me show you a senior-level, scalable architecture with detailed reasoning.Here's the full breakdown of what changed and why — from a senior engineer's perspective:

---

**The biggest shift: feature-first domain modules**

Your current structure has `src/modules/` but likely puts everything flat inside it. The upgrade is to give each domain (`auth`, `users`, `orders`, etc.) its own internal layered structure — controllers, services, repositories, dto, guards, interfaces — all self-contained. This means a new developer can read just the `auth/` folder and understand the entire auth domain without jumping around.

**`core/` vs `common/` vs `shared/` — the three-layer split**

This is where most projects stay junior. The separation matters:

- `core/` — singletons that bootstrap the app: `DatabaseModule`, `CacheModule`, `LoggerModule`. Imported once into `AppModule`.
- `common/` — NestJS building blocks (decorators, interceptors, pipes, filters, guards) that are used across many modules but are NestJS-specific.
- `shared/` — pure TypeScript utilities, helpers, validators, constants. No NestJS dependency. Easily testable in isolation, potentially extracted to a package later.

**Repository pattern inside each module**

Your current setup likely has services talking directly to Prisma. A `repositories/` layer per module gives you a clean abstraction — services stay pure business logic, repositories own all data access. When you swap Prisma for something else, you only touch the repository.

**`config/` with validation**

The `config.validation.ts` file (using `@hapi/joi` or `class-validator` + `@nestjs/config`) validates all environment variables at startup. The app crashes immediately with a clear error rather than failing silently at runtime when a missing `JWT_SECRET` causes a 500 in production.

**`health/` module**

A `GET /health` endpoint (using `@nestjs/terminus`) is non-negotiable in production. Kubernetes, ECS, load balancers, and monitoring tools all probe it. Takes 10 minutes to add and saves you in incidents.

**Test structure**

Move unit tests (`*.spec.ts`) co-located with the file they test — same folder. The `test/` directory holds only e2e specs and fixtures. This is the NestJS convention and keeps the feedback loop fast.

**`.env.example` and `.env.test`**

`.env.example` is committed to git — it documents every variable with safe placeholder values. `.env.test` is a separate config for your test runner pointing to a test database, so your e2e tests never touch production or dev data.

Let me build you a comprehensive interactive reference for every file and folder.The interactive reference above covers every file and folder — click any entry to expand it and see the full code example. You can also filter by category (Core, Modules, Common, Config, Tests, Root) or search by filename or keyword.

A few things worth highlighting that the examples demonstrate together:

The `repository → service → controller` chain is the most important pattern to internalize. The repository owns every Prisma query. The service owns all business logic and never touches Prisma directly. The controller owns HTTP — it just calls the service and returns the result. This makes each layer independently testable and swappable.

The `config.validation.ts` file using Joi is something most junior projects skip. The moment you add it, a missing `DATABASE_URL` or a weak `JWT_SECRET` crashes the app at startup with a readable error instead of causing a mysterious 500 at 2am in production.

The `TransformInterceptor` + `HttpExceptionFilter` combo in `main.ts` ensures every single response — success or error — comes out with the same envelope shape. Your frontend team will thank you because they can always count on `response.data` and `response.success`.

The `.env.example` being committed to git is a discipline thing. When a new developer joins or you deploy to a new server, there's a single source of truth for what variables are needed and what format they should be in.
